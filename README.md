# push_swap

## Description
This task requires arranging information on a stack using a restricted set of commands while minimizing the number of actions needed. To achieve this goal, you'll need to handle different sorting methods and select the most suitable approach for efficiently organizing the data.

## Usage
### Compiling
Run the following commands:
- To compile
  ```shell
  $ make
  ```
- To remove objects:
  ```shell
  $ make clean
  ```
- To remove objects and binary file (program):
  ```shell
  $ make fclean
  ```
- To re-compile:
  ```shell
  $ make re
  ```


### execute
  ```shell
  $ ./push_swap 4 5 1 2 0
  rra
  pb
  rra
  rra
  pb
  pa
  pa
  ```
